Laser Run Game Manual
ver. 1.4.7


To exit the game, at any point, press the ESCAPE key on your keyboard. 

The player (in white) can be controlled by using the W, A, S, and D, keys to move up, down, left, and right, respectively. 

The goal of the game is to kill the most enemies and last the longest.

At the launch of the game, you must select a class for your player.
Automatically, the Archer class is pre-selected. 
The classes are: Archer, Swordsman, Arsonist, Boomeranger, Spy, Artillery, Mage, and Lancer.

Archers should be used by players with good aim and timing.
An archer can either use a Daggar as a melee weapon, or an Arrow as a ranged weapon.

Swordsman should be used by players wishing to do close combat.
A swordsman can either use a Longsword as a melee weapon, or a Spear as a ranged weapon.

Arsonists should be used by players who like to blow enemies up.
An arsonist can either use a Daggar as a melee weapon, or a Spear as a ranged weapon.
Further, by pressing the Q key, the arsonist will release a bomb.
This will blow up anything within a 100-pixel radius.
It will cost 2 ammo and some stamina.

Boomerangers should be used by players with good timing and prediction skills.
A boomeranger can either use a Daggar as a melee weapon, or a Boomerang as a ranged weapon.
If a boomeranger makes contact with the boomerang, after the boomerang has hit the wall, the boomerang will be collected, and one ammo will be restored.

Spies should be used by players who enjoy sneaking around the map.
Spies can either use a Daggar as a melee weapon, or a Spear as a ranged weapon.
Spies can sneak by pressing the Q key. The spy will not take any damage, and will disappear.

Artilleries should be used by players who want to spam their shots.
Artilleries can either use a Daggar as a melee weapon, or a Bolt as a ranged weapon.

Mages should be used by players who hate the temperate enemy types (dragons, flames, snowmen, and icicles).
A mage can either use a Staff as a melee weapon, or a Spell as a ranged weapon.
The mage is not affected by any enemy which deals temperature damage (dragons, flames, snowmen, and icicles).
The mage cannot take temperature damage.

Lancers should be used by players who are trying to have strong damage per second, with a challanging aspect.
The lancer can either use a Lance as a melee weapon, or a Javalin as a ranged weapon.
Lancers have a third the health of any other player class.

The Daggar is the weakest melee weapon in the game.
It is short and wide.

The Staff is a weapon which is weaker than the Daggar.

The Longsword is the strongest melee weapon in the game.
It is long and thin.

The Spear is the weakest ranged weapon in the game.
It is long and thing.

The Spell is a weapon which is weaker than the Spear.
The Spell is a 30 x 30 square.

The Boomerang is a ranged weapon which can hit multiple enemies.
It will bounce off one wall, and will delete when it hits its second wall.
The Boomerang looks like an L-shaped, white object.

The Bolt is a ranged weapon which, although damage-wise is weaker than the spear, there can be multiple Bolts on the screen at the same time.
The Bolt looks like a thinner arrow.

The Arrow is a very powerful ranged weapon in the game.
It's strength increases as the distance between the player and the enemy increases.
Thus, it is useful to try to snipe the enemies from across the map.

The Lance is an extremely powerful melee weapon. 
It has a high damage output.
It is thin and long, and as such, has better accuracy.

The Javalin is an extremely powerful ranged weapon. 
It has a high damage output, and moves very quickly.
It is thin and long, and as such, has better accuracy.

A map can be selected at the bottom of the launcher screen, in a drop-down selector.
Test out the maps to learn the challenges presented in each.

There are 3 modes to the game: MODE 1, MODE 2, and MODE 3; each gets progressively more difficult. 
To select a game mode, click on the number keys: 1, 2, or 3, in the first 10 seconds of entering the game.
If you fail to do so, the score won't be counted properly.

There are 5 inventory slots (in between the temperature bar and the stamina bar).
Each slot can hold one Usable.
A usable is an item which can be stored in the inventory and used any time.
To use something from your inventory, use the Z, X, C, V, or B keys, to use the first, second, third, fourth, or fifth item, respectively.

The Sachel (long, gray) is a usable which increases the player's maximum ammo by 1.
The Quiver (light gray with a dark gray core) is a usable which fills the player's ammo to max.
The Treasure Chest (brown with a gold core) is a usable which grants the player an extra 100 bonus points.
The Orb of Death (dark gray with a black core) is a usable which allows the player to use the Death Wish again.
The Summoning Wand (short, stubby, and brown) is a usable which allows the player to summon a boss to battle.
The Coffee (looks like a gray coffee cup with some brown coffee in it) is a usable which fills the player's stamina to the max.
The Herb (looks like a herb double leaf) is a usable which fills the player's health to the max.

There is a health bar (in green) in the top left corner of the screen. 
If the player's health bar is fully diminished, then the game is over.

There is a stamina bar (in cyan) in the top right corner of the screen.
If the player's stamina bar is fully diminished, the abilities of the player will be restricted for a period of time, until stamina is restored.

To the right of the 5 inventory (separated by a space) is a single slot for charms.
Charms are in effect constantly, and as such, are not "used".
In order to discard a charm, press E.

The Charm of Strength grants the player a greater maximum stamina.
The Charm of Supply grants the player a greater maximum ammo.
The Charm of Healing grants the player a greater maximum health.
The Charm of The Sea allows the player to traverse the water.

The player can shoot to the up, down, left, or right, by using the keys: I, K, J, or L, respectively. 
Alternatively, you can use the arrow keys.
This will produce a projectile, headed in the direction chosen (in white).
The player will lose 1/10 of a full bar of stamina, per shot.
Only one shot can be visible at a time
i.e. you will have to wait for either the laser to hit a target, or for it to go off the screen, before you can shoot again.

In order to be able to shoot, you must use a single ammo.
You can hold a maximum of 8 ammo at the beginning of the game.
Your Ammo Bar (in varying shades of gray) can be seen in the upper center of your screen, below the Health and Stamina bars.

If the player is not shooting, a shield can be activated.
Shields are only activated in one direction at a time.
In order to use the shield, in the directions up, down, left, or right, use the keys: I, K, J, or L, respectively.
Alternatively, you can use the arrow keys.
In order to toggle between laser-mode and shield-mode, use semicolon key (;); alternatively, use the 0 key on the number pad.
When a shield is activated, it reflects any objects it contacts.
For each object that it contacts, it will restore a small amount of health and stamina. 
You can move with a shield activated by holding the directional key down, while moving.

The player's melee attack can be toggled by holding the H key or the SHIFT key. 
Then, continue to use the I, J, K, and L, or arrow keys.

Enemies (in red) will deal damage (to health) upon contact with the player.
If an enemy is shot with a projectile, the enemy will die, and the player will regain a small amount of health and stamina.
All enemies drop one dust.

Water (a large blue field of color) is untraversable by the player unless the Charm of The Sea is held by the player.

Dusts are a collective term used for the following: 
Stamina Dust (tiny cyan), Health Dust (tiny green), Coins (tiny gold), Ammo (tiny grey), Ash (tiny gray), Acid (tiny purple), Frost (tiny light blue), and Magma (tiny orange).
Stamina Dust will restore a small amount of Stamina.
Health Dust will restore a small amount of Health.
Ammo will grant you one ammo. 
Coins will give you 15 points for the end of the game, and will make progress towards upgrades on your Coin Bar.
Ash cannot be collected by the player; it does nothing.
Acid can be collected by the player, but it will lose the player 1/100 of the full heath bar, and will inflict poison for 1 second.
Frost can be collected by the player to decrease temperature.
Magma can be collected by the player to increase temperature.

If you shoot any of these with a laser, not only will they yield the reward described above, but they will also give you an additional 10 points.

The Coin Bar (below the ammo bar) is a gold colored bar. 
Whenever your maximum number of bullets is equal to the number of Coins on your Coin Bar, you will lose all those Coins.
At this point, you will gain an extra slot for ammo, thus increasing your maximum ammo. 
Maximum ammo can be increased up to 40.

Ammo Packs (regular-sized, in light gray, with gold edging) appear on the game screen.
These can be harvested to gain a full 8 ammo. Any ammo which could not be fit into your 8 maximum is dropped on the floor of the game as Ammo (the dust).

Stamina is not regenerated over time always, but 1/4 of a full bar of stamina will be gained if the player collects a power up (in green, with gold edging).
Health is regenerated over time, but 1/4 of a full bar of health will be gained if the player collects a power up.
Upon collecting a power up, the player will temporarily appear green.
Bullets, when the player is powered up, will not only appear green, but will increase in size.

Stamina can be regenerated by standing still. 
While you move, you loose Stamina, which, upon reaching 0, will reduce your movement speed.
If you reduce your Stamina to 0, it will take significantly longer to regenerate than otherwise. 
As such, it is wise to take frequent breaks from movement.

The temperature bar is a bar between the stamina and health bars. 
Its color varies based on your current temperature.
Temperature can range from positive to negative 100.
You will take damage each second if your temperature is greater than 50 or less than -50. 

Temperature can go up by using a Hot Spot (burgundy, with gold edging).
Temperature can go down by using a Chill Pill (sky blue, with gold edging).

Health is regenerated slowly over time.

Energizers (regular-sized, in cyan, with a gold edging) will appear across the map.
If you collect an Energizer, your Stamina will be restored by 3/4 of a full bar.

In order to sprint, for a limited amount of time (according to the stamina bar), press the SPACE BAR. 
The player's size should decrease slightly.
In order to disengage the sprint, press the SPACE BAR.
The player's size should return to normal.

The killing of enemies of any type will produce blood, which is scattered across the map.

In time, enemies will spawn. 
The more enemies you kill, the quicker they spawn back.

An imp (small, red) can spawn, instead of an enemy. 
Imps are faster than enemies, but will not damage you as much.

Occasionally, thieves will spawn.
Thieves (in red, accented in maroon) are a special type of enemy.
On contact with you, not only will they damage you, but they will steal all of your ammo.
When a thief is killed, it will drop 3 dusts, with a guaranteed one ammo.

Occasionally, witches will spawn.
Witches (in red, accented in purple) are a special type of enemy.
On contact with you, not only will they damage you, but they will inflict poison on you.
Poison removes 1/50 of a full bar of health per second.

Occasionally, psychics will spawn, in groups of two.
Psychics (in red, accented in magenta) are a special type of enemy.
There are two types of psychics: Typicals and Atypicals.
There is no visual distinction between the two.
Typicals are killed by being shot with an projectile.
On contact with a Typical, you will take damage.
Atypicals are killed by being contacted directly by the player.
If an Atypical is struck with a projectile, you will take damage.

Occasionally, flames will spawn.
Flames (in red, accented in orange-red) are a special type of enemy.
On contact with you, not only will they damage you, but they will deal you burns.
1 second after receiving a burn, the damage dealt to get the burn, will be dealt again (thus, double damage).
Immediately after this, the burn will be removed.
Every 5 seconds, flames will shoot out flame projectiles, which will damage you in an identical way to the flame itself.
If you shoot a flame projectile with a projectile, both, the projectile and the laser, will be destroyed.
On contact, your temperature will increase.

Occasionally, creepers will spawn.
Creepers (in red, accented in dark or neon green) are a special type of enemy.
On contact with you, creepers do regular damage.
If you get within sight range of a creeper, it will explode, causing the player to lose 1/10 of a full health bar.
When a creeper is not triggered, it will be accented in dark green.
When a creeper becomes triggered, it will be lit, and will be accented in neon green.

Occasionally, ghouls will spawn.
Ghouls (in red, accented in light gray) are a special type of enemy.
On contact with you, ghouls do regular damage.
In time, the ghoul will disappear for a few seconds.

Occasionally, collectors will spawn.
Collectors (in red, accented in gold) are a special type of enemy.
On contact with you, collectors do regular damage.
If a collector comes into contact with any dust, the dust will be removed/collected by the collector.
On death, the collector will drop anything that it collected, along with three additional bonus dusts.

Occasionally, vampires will spawn.
Vampires (in red, accented in pale) are a special type of enemy.
On contact with you, vampires do damage corresponding to the amount of blood they have in their system.
A vampire starts with a base of 1 blood in its system.
If a vampire comes in contact with a blood particle, it will be digested, and will increase the strength of the vampire.
Thus, it will do more damage.
On death, the vampire will drop a number of dusts equal to the strength of the vampire, with an additional two bonus dusts.

Occasionally, icicles will spawn.
Icicles (in red, accented in cyan), on contact with you, will make you frozen.
On contact, your temperature will decrease.
If you are frozen, it takes longer to stop, and you will slide all over the map.

Occasionally, wizards will spawn.
Wizards (in red, accented in blue), on contact with you, will deal normal damage.
They can be shot normally.
Wizards cannot be blocked by a shield.

Occasionally, snowmen will spawn.
Snowmen (in cyan, with a red border), on contact with you, will deal regular damage.
They can be shot normally.
On contact, your temperature will decrease.
Snowmen will grow in size on contact with frost dusts.

Occasionally, pirates might spawn.
Pirates (in red, accented in beige), on contact with you, will deal regular damage.
Pirates will only spawn if there is water on the map or if it is raining.

Occasionally, sea serpents mights spawn.
Sea serpents (zig zagged with red and blue), on contact with you, will deal extra damage.
Sea serpents will only spawn if there is water on the map of if it is raining.

Occasionally, sphinxes might spawn.
Sphinxes (in red, accented in dark brown), on contact with you, will deal extra damage.
Sphinxes will only spawn if the map climate is arid, or if a sandstorm is occuring.

In order to remove poison, you must use an antidote. 
Antidotes (in purple, with gold edging) can be shot or contacted directly with the player.
On harvesting of an antidote, all poison will be removed.

Once per game, a Magnet will spawn (looks like a magnet, gray with pink tips).
If you touch the magnet, it will attach to your person, and allow you to collect dusts easier.
If you shoot the magnet, it will break, and be lost forever.
If an enemy gets to the magnet first, the magnet will be lost forever.

Once per game, a Teleporter will spawn (in green, accented in magenta).
If you run into it, it will teleport you across the map.
If you shoot a laser into it, the laser will continue on the other side of the map.

Once per game, a Climate Controller will spawn (larger than the player, white edging). 
It will always set the player's temperature to 0.
It lasts for 5 seconds.

In time, battles will occur.
 
In a boss battle, spawned, will be a boss (a large, fast moving, red enemy) and 3 regular enemies.
Each time that a boss is spawned, the health of the boss will increase.
Thus, each boss battle is progressively more difficult, as it will take more laser shots to kill the boss each time.

In a summoner battle, spawned, will be a summoner (a slightly larger than enemy, red object, normal moving speed). 
The summoner has two health, and, it thus, takes two shots to kill.
Summoners will summon regular enemies to the field every 5 seconds.
Thus, it is recommended to kill the summoner as quickly as possible.

In an imp swarm battle, spawned, will be several imps. 
These are all regular imps, but there are very many swarming you all of a sudden.

In a dragon battle, spawned, will be a dragon (red, with a tail extending to the right edge of the screen).
The dragon has four health, and, it thus, takes four shots to kill.
The dragon is only vulnerable on its head. 
If a dragon makes contact with the player, it will do extra damage.
If a dragon contacts a dust, it will turn into ash.
Ash will despawn over time, similar to any other dust.
If a dragon touches an Energizer, Health Orb, Charged Orb, Magnet, Antidote, or Ammo Pack, it will turn into fire.
Fire will never be removed from the field.
Fire will cause you pain if you touch it.
If you touch either the fire or the dragon, it will increase your temperature.

In an enemy camp battle, spawned, will be an enemy camp (red border) with 4 enemies (red).
In order to destroy an enemy camp, the camp must be struck with a laser 4 times, killing each of the 4 enemies.
If you make contact with an enemy camp, it will damage you corresponding to the number of enemies left in the camp.

In a skeleton battle, spawned, will be a skeleton (player-sized, in red, with a light gray core), and a ghoul. 
This is a special ghoul, though, as it is the means by which the skeleton dies.
The skeleton has put its soul into the ghoul. 
The skeleton cannot be attacked directly, but instead, should be attacked towards the ghoul.
The ghoul's properties remain constant to a standard ghoul.
A skeleton can take on the attributes of any type of regular-sized enemy (even of special types).
In order to disengage this skeleton, you must shoot it with a projectile.

In a wizard tower battle, spawned, will be a wizard tower (large hollow, blue shape with a red outline).
Also spawned will be a wizard at the center of the tower.
In order to reach the wizard, you must first destroy the tower.
The tower does not move.
In order to destroy the tower, you must shoot it 5 times.
Then, the wizard will be released, and you must kill it to gain the bonus points for the boss battle.

Occasionally, a blue object will appear on the screen. This object is the Charged Orb. 
If an projectile hits a Charged Orb, the projectiles will multiply. 
Note that this will cost you 1/5 of a full bar of Stamina, and will not occur if you lack the Stamina.
If you walk into a Charged Orb, you will become SuperCharged (in blue). 
Note that this will cost you 3/25 of a full bar of Stamina, and will not occur if you lack the Stamina.
If an enemy walks into a Charged Orb, it will become a Charged Enemy (in blue).
If, by chance, a Charged Orb makes contact with a Power Up, you will gain 800 points.

Once per game, if you are feeling overwhelmed by the number of enemies, you can press the R key to use your Death Wish.
The Death Wish will remove a large portion of the enemies, making them much more manageable.

At a random time, a weather event might fire.
The Rain weather event will last for 8-12 seconds, and will smother all fire, and kill all Flames. The background will be dark blue.
The Snow weather event will last for 6-10 seconds, and will make you frozen, making you slide all across the map. The background will be dark gray.
The Fog weather event will last for 6-10 seconds, and will make your screen freeze, as if you cannot see where the enemies are located. The background will be dark gray.
The Volcanic Eruption weather event will last for 8-12 seconds, and will spawn fire and magma across the map. The background will be dark orange.
The Sandstorm weather event will last for 10-20 seconds, and will allow for arid mobs to spawn. The background will be dark brown.

The frames per second, number of kills, and game time can be seen in the console of the game.

Upon death of the player, the playthrough's statistics will appear on the screen in a textbox.
To exit the game, at this point, click OK. 
Watch out for the memes as your death messages.

Good luck, and have fun.
